Making SIP Calls




Use Twilio's REST API to connect to your SIP-enabled endpoints. With this feature, you can set up a VoIP session using SIP. If you are unfamiliar with SIP, or want more information on how Twilio works with your SIP endpoint, please see the SIP overview.

HTTP POST to Calls





Initiate SIP sessions via the REST API by POSTing to the same calls resource used to make outbound phone calls. Once the call is connected, Twilio will then fetch the TwiML you specify for the call. For example, make a SIP call by POSTing to your account's calls list resource URI:



Copy code block
 /2010-04-01/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Calls
POST Parameters





All outgoing call features and parameters are supported — the only difference is that you pass different values in the "To" and "From" parameters. In the "To" parameter, put the SIP URI you are trying to connect to. In the "From" parameter, specify the user you want to show up in the From header in the SIP request.

Required Parameters

You must POST the following parameters:

Parameter	Description
To	The SIP URI to which you want to connect
The 'To' parameter specifies a SIP address for Twilio to connect to. The body of the URI element should be a valid SIP URI under 255 characters. For example:



Copy code block
sip:michael@example.com
Headers

Pass headers in the To parameter by appending them to the end of the SIP URI. For certain sdks, & will need encoding as %26. The total characters passed in a header must be under 1024. For example:



Copy code block
sip:michael@example.com?mycustomheader=foo&myotherheader=bar
Transport

Set a parameter on your SIP URI to specify what transport protocol you want to use. You may use UDP, TCP or TLS. By default, Twilio sends your SIP INVITE over UDP. Change this by using the transport parameter:



Copy code block
sip:jack@example.com;transport=tcp
Also, when using transport=tls, this will only encrypt SIP signaling messages and not RTP. To use SRTP and to encrypt SIP signaling, please add a parameter secure=true to your SIP URI:



Copy code block
sip:jack@example.com;secure=true
Optional Parameters

You may POST the following parameters:

Parameter	Description
From	This value is used to populate the username portion of the From header that is passed to the SIP endpoint. This may be any alphanumeric character, as well as the plus, minus, underscore, and period characters (+-_.). No spaces or other characters are allowed.
SipAuthUsername	Your authentication username.
SipAuthPassword	The password for the user.
Create a SIP Dial

Basic SIP dial using the REST API.
