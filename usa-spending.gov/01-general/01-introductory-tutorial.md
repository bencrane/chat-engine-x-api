# Introductory Tutorial

Introductory Tutorial

Welcome to the introductory USAspending API tutorial. This tutorial is designed for people who aren't familiar with APIs and how to use them. If you already know what an endpoint is and the difference between GET and POST, you'll want to visit Endpoints. The Documentation Index provides links to introductory resources and tutorials to help you get started.

What's an API?

API stands for Application Programmer Interface. APIs make it easy for computer programs to request and receive information in a format they can understand.

If you're looking for federal spending data that's designed to be read by humans instead of computers, you should head to https://www.usaspending.gov">our website.

Using the API

The next few sections will cover different ways to access the API, how to filter the data, how to use autocomplete endpoints, and how to find more information.

You do not need to complete this tutorial in its entirety to get started. Feel free to stop and experiment with your own ideas as you progress.

Endpoint Overview

When you type a URL into your browser, it usually returns a web page: a document that your browser knows how to display for you to read. APIs use URLs too, but instead of returning formatted web pages, API URLs return data that is structured so computers can easily parse it. API URLs are called endpoints. Just as many pages make up a website, many endpoints make up an API.

The USAspending API supports a number of endpoints. For example /api/v2/search/spending_by_award/ is our Advanced Award Search endpoint for the Spending by Award table.

GET vs POST requests

Most endpoints support both GET and POST methods for making a request.

Requests for a specific record (with a known numerical identifier) are made via a GET request. For example, a request to /api/v2/references/agency/456/ would retrieve the agency's metadata with identifier 456.

You can also use simple filters in a GET request. An example of this would be /api/v2/financial_balances/agencies?funding_agency=775&fiscal_year=2017, which would retrieves financial balance information by funding agency, with the identifier of 775 and a fiscal year of 2017.

POST requests are leveraged in situations where more advanced filtering is required. For example, /api/v2/search/spending_by_award/ would have filters as such:

{
  "filters": {
       "award_type_codes": ["10"],
       "agencies": [
            {
                 "type": "awarding",
                 "tier": "toptier",
                 "name": "Social Security Administration"
            },
            {
                 "type": "awarding",
                 "tier": "subtier",
                 "name": "Social Security Administration"
            },
            {
                 "type": "funding",
                 "tier": "toptier",
                 "name": "Social Security Administration"
            },
            {
                 "type": "funding",
                 "tier": "subtier",
                 "name": "Social Security Administration"
            }
