# Voice Insights

## Voice Insights Overview

Voice Insights provides call quality analytics and aggregation tools for investigating Twilio calls and conferences. Sensors in the Twilio Voice SDKs and on Twilio media gateways gather call metrics and events and send them to the Voice Insights platform for analysis and aggregation.

Once aggregated, these Call Insights and Conference Insights are made available through powerful reporting dashboards and detailed summaries in the Twilio Console to highlight aspects of call and conference behavior.

Voice Insights for Twilio Voice SDKs allows you to react to call quality events directly in your Twilio SDK code. For a reference of related Voice SDK events, please see Details: Voice Insights SDK Events.

> **Info:** Voice Insights data is available for calls or conferences made within the last 30 days.

Voice Insights Advanced Features provide you with valuable additional analytical capabilities to investigate call and conference quality issues by:

- exploring time-series data of metrics and event streams in the Twilio Console,
- programmatically accessing, via the Voice Insights REST API or Voice Insights Event Streams,
- call summaries, call metrics, call insights events and call annotations, or
- conference summaries and conference participant summaries.

> **Info:** Advanced Features are available at an additional cost to regular call charges. Please, see our Voice Pricing pages for Voice Insights pay-as-you-go and committed pricing information.

Voice Insights is available for all calls and conferences made using:

- one of the Twilio Voice SDKs:
  - Voice JavaScript SDK (v1.3+),
  - Voice iOS SDK (v3.0+), or
  - Voice Android SDK (v3.0+),
- the Programmable Voice APIs, or
- Elastic SIP Trunking.
