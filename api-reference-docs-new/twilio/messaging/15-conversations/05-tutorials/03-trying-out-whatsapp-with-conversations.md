# Trying Out WhatsApp with Conversations

This tutorial shows you how to use Twilio Conversations with Twilio's Sandbox for WhatsApp. Twilio controls a dedicated WhatsApp phone number that you can use to test WhatsApp messaging in Conversations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A Twilio account—sign up for a free account if you need one.
- The Twilio CLI.
- Your Account SID and Auth Token, available in the Twilio Console.

Note: This tutorial shows both the Conversations API approach and a more basic Messages API alternative. If you're having issues with Conversations, try the Messages API method first.

## Step 1: Opt in to the Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp

You can test your application in a developer environment by connecting to the Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp.

Go to the Conversations > Try it out section in the Twilio Console. Choose a use case, then send the "join <your Sandbox keyword>" WhatsApp message from your device to the Twilio Sandbox for a WhatsApp phone number to connect to your sandbox.

Once you've joined Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox, you'll receive a confirmation message. To disconnect from the sandbox, you can reply to the message from WhatsApp with the word "stop".

Important: Note down your Sandbox WhatsApp number (typically starts with +1415). You'll need this for the next steps.

## Step 2: Quick test with Messages API (Recommended first step)

Before diving into Conversations, let's verify your WhatsApp Sandbox works with a basic message:

```bash
curl 'https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json' -X POST \
--data-urlencode 'To=whatsapp:YOUR_WHATSAPP_NUMBER' \
--data-urlencode 'From=whatsapp:TWILIO_SANDBOX_NUMBER' \
--data-urlencode 'Body=Testing WhatsApp Sandbox!' \
-u YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID:YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

Replace:

- **YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID:** Your Account SID from the Console
- **YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN:** Your Auth Token from the Console
- **YOUR_WHATSAPP_NUMBER:** Your phone number in E.164 format (e.g., +14155238886)
- **TWILIO_SANDBOX_NUMBER:** The Sandbox number (e.g., +14155238886)

If this works, you should receive a WhatsApp message. If not, check:

- You've joined the sandbox correctly
- Your phone number format is correct (E.164)
- Your credentials are valid

## Step 3: Remove the inbound URL (Optional but recommended)

In this tutorial, we won't need to set a webhook URL for inbound messaging. To remove the existing testing webhook URL configured in the WhatsApp Sandbox's settings section, go to the Messaging > Try it out > Send a WhatsApp message > Sandbox Settings section in the Twilio Console and remove the webhook URL. Click Save.

Not doing so would result in a reply requesting to update the configuration for your WhatsApp Sandbox's Inbound URL when you send your first message.

## Step 4: Create a conversation

After you have your Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp configured, create your first Conversation.

Let's make a Conversation using the Twilio CLI (but remember that you can choose another tool for making the API requests):

```bash
# Install the twilio-cli from https://twil.io/cli

twilio api:conversations:v1:conversations:create \
    --friendly-name "whatsapp-sandbox-test"
```

Copy the Conversation SID that starts with CHXXXXXXX. You'll use this value in the next steps.

If this command fails, verify:

- Twilio CLI is installed and authenticated (`twilio profiles:list`)
- Your account has Conversations enabled

## Step 5: Add a WhatsApp participant to the conversation

You've created a Conversation, which you can think of as a virtual space that users can join using a channel of their choice.

Next, you'll add yourself as a WhatsApp Participant. The following code sample does this for you. You'll need to replace the following information:

- **CHXXXXXXXXXXX:** the Conversation SID.
- **YOUR_WHATSAPP_NUMBER:** your own mobile phone number in E.164 format.
- **TWI_SANDBOX_WA_NUMBER:** the Twilio Sandbox WhatsApp phone number in E.164 format.

```bash
# Install the twilio-cli from https://twil.io/cli

twilio api:conversations:v1:conversations:participants:create \
    --conversation-sid CHXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
    --messaging-binding.address whatsapp:YOUR_WHATSAPP_NUMBER \
    --messaging-binding.proxy-address whatsapp:TWI_SANDBOX_WA_NUMBER
```

Troubleshooting: If you get an error about the proxy address, verify:

- You're using the correct Sandbox number
- You've successfully joined the Sandbox
- The numbers are in E.164 format

## Step 6: Add a chat participant to the conversation

For this step, you'll add a chat Participant to the Conversation (remember that you can also add an SMS Participant).

The following code sample does this for you. You'll need to replace the following information:

- **CHXXXXXXXXXX:** the Conversation SID.
- **<Chat_User_Identity>:** the identity of your chat user. In this tutorial, you will use "chat-user".

```bash
# Install the twilio-cli from https://twil.io/cli

twilio api:conversations:v1:conversations:participants:create \
    --conversation-sid CHXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
    --identity "chat-user"
```

Conversation created. Two participants added.

You can start communicating.

## Step 7: Send a message from WhatsApp to the Sandbox number

Send a WhatsApp message to your Sandbox number. You should see it appear in the Conversation.

## Step 8: Reply via Conversations API

Reply to the WhatsApp message using the Conversations API:

```bash
twilio api:conversations:v1:conversations:messages:create \
    --conversation-sid CHXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
    --author "chat-user" \
    --body "Hello from the Conversations API"
```

Replace CHXXXXXXX with your Conversation SID and add the content of the message that you'd like to send.

## Alternative: Using Messages API directly

If you're having issues with the Conversations approach, you can send messages directly using the Messages API:

```bash
# Using Twilio CLI
twilio api:core:messages:create \
    --to whatsapp:YOUR_WHATSAPP_NUMBER \
    --from whatsapp:TWILIO_SANDBOX_NUMBER \
    --body "Direct message via Messages API"

# Or using curl
curl 'https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json' -X POST \
--data-urlencode 'To=whatsapp:YOUR_WHATSAPP_NUMBER' \
--data-urlencode 'From=whatsapp:TWILIO_SANDBOX_NUMBER' \
--data-urlencode 'Body=Direct message via Messages API' \
-u YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID:YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

## Step 9: Monitor your conversations

To verify messages are flowing through Conversations, check Monitor > Logs > Messaging in the Console.

## Troubleshooting common issues

### "Conversation not found" errors

- Verify your Conversation SID is correct
- Check that the Conversation was created successfully

### WhatsApp messages not appearing

- Ensure you've joined the Sandbox correctly
- Verify the webhook URL is cleared in Sandbox settings
- Check that participants were added successfully

### Authentication errors

- Verify your Account SID and Auth Token
- Ensure Twilio CLI is authenticated: `twilio profiles:list`

### Participant creation failures

- Double-check phone number format (E.164)
- Verify you're using the correct Sandbox number
- Ensure you've joined the Sandbox
