# Configuring Custom Endpoints
Source: https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/custom-endpoints

Instructions for using Deepgram's EU endpoint, Dedicated endpoints, and self-hosted endpoints with your applications.

This guide provides instructions for configuring your applications to use Deepgram's European Union (EU) endpoint, Deepgram Dedicated endpoints, or self-hosted endpoints.

## EU Endpoint

For customers requiring data processing within the EU, Deepgram provides an EU-specific endpoint at api.eu.deepgram.com. While Deepgram guarantees the service will be hosted within the EU, the specific country location may change over time. If you require hosting in a specific EU country, consider Deepgram Dedicated (see also our technical documentation).

**Endpoint URL:** `api.eu.deepgram.com`

### How to Configure

- **Replace the base URL:** In any SDK or API request, replace `api.deepgram.com` with `api.eu.deepgram.com`
- **Use your existing credentials:** You can use your existing API keys and tokens.

### Feature Compatibility

The EU endpoint supports the following Deepgram APIs:

- **Speech-to-Text:** `/v1/listen` and `/v2/listen` (excluding Whisper models)
- **Text-to-Speech:** `/v1/speak`
- **Voice Agent:** `/v1/agent/converse`
- **Text Intelligence:** `/v1/read`

See our API Documentation for more information.

## Deepgram Dedicated Endpoints

Deepgram Dedicated allows you to run speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and voice agent workloads with performance, compliance, and regional control, without the complexity of managing infrastructure.

If you have a Deepgram Dedicated (DGD) endpoint, you'll receive endpoint details similar to:

**Endpoint URL:** `{SHORT_UID}.{REGION_SUBDOMAIN}.api.deepgram.com`

### How to Configure

- **Replace the base URL:** In any SDK or API request, replace `api.deepgram.com` with your dedicated endpoint URL.
- **Use your existing credentials:** You can use your existing API keys and tokens.

### Feature Compatibility

All Deepgram API features are available on self-hosted deployments. See our API Documentation for more information.

## Self-Hosted Endpoints

For self-hosted Deepgram deployments, you'll use your own custom domain and infrastructure.

**Common Endpoint Patterns:**

- **HTTPS:** `https://your-deepgram-instance.com`
- **HTTP with alternate port 8080:** `http://your-deepgram-instance.com:8080`
- **Internal network:** `http://10.0.1.100:8080`

### How to configure

For more information about self-hosted deployments, see our Self-Hosted Documentation.

- **Replace the base URL:** In any SDK or API request, replace `api.deepgram.com` with your self-hosted endpoint
- **Use your distribution credentials:** Self-hosted deployments require specific credentials provided during setup.
- **Configure protocol and port:** Specify HTTP/HTTPS and custom ports as needed for your deployment.

### Feature Compatibility

All Deepgram API features are available on self-hosted deployments. See our API Documentation for more information.

## Known Limitations

Some features and configurations have limitations depending on the endpoint or region. Review the following before configuring your application.

Flux is not currently available in the EU region. Support for Flux in the EU region is actively being worked on and will be available in a future update.
