              I recently sat down with Matt Zahab from Cryptonews to discuss a
              range of topics, including the potential of Bitcoin ETFs, the
              impact of the upcoming Halving, and how DeFi is shaping the future
              of capital markets. I also shared some thoughts on what 2024 might
              hold for the crypto space. It was a thought-provoking conversation
              that I believe offers valuable insights for anyone interested in
              the future of finance. Dive into the full interview:
