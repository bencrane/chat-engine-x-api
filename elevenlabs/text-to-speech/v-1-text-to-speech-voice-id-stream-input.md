GET /v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}/stream-input

The Text-to-Speech WebSockets API is designed to generate audio from partial text input
while ensuring consistency throughout the generated audio. Although highly flexible,
the WebSockets API isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. It's well-suited for scenarios where:
  * The input text is being streamed or generated in chunks.
  * Word-to-audio alignment information is required.

However, it may not be the best choice when:
  * The entire input text is available upfront. Given that the generations are partial,
    some buffering is involved, which could potentially result in slightly higher latency compared
    to a standard HTTP request.
  * You want to quickly experiment or prototype. Working with WebSockets can be harder and more
    complex than using a standard HTTP API, which might slow down rapid development and testing.

            This is an advanced setting that most users shouldn't need to use.
            It relates to our

            generation schedule.


            Our WebSocket service incorporates a buffer system designed to
            optimize the Time To First Byte (TTFB) while maintaining
            high-quality streaming.


            All text sent to the WebSocket endpoint is added to this buffer and
            only when that buffer reaches a certain size is an audio generation
            attempted. This is because our model provides higher quality audio
            when the model has longer inputs, and can deduce more context about
            how the text should be delivered.


            The buffer ensures smooth audio data delivery and is automatically
            emptied with a final audio generation either when the stream is
            closed, or upon sending a `flush` command. We have advanced settings
            for changing the chunk schedule, which can improve latency at the
            cost of quality by generating audio more frequently with smaller
            text inputs.


            The `chunk_length_schedule` determines the minimum amount of text
            that needs to be sent and present in our

            buffer before audio starts being generated. This is to maximise the
            amount of context available to

            the model to improve audio quality, whilst balancing latency of the
            returned audio chunks.


            The default value for `chunk_length_schedule` is: [120, 160, 250,
            290].


            This means that the first chunk of audio will not be generated until
            you send text that

            totals at least 120 characters long. The next chunk of audio will
            only be generated once a

            further 160 characters have been sent. The third audio chunk will be
            generated after the

            next 250 characters. Then the fourth, and beyond, will be generated
            in sets of at least 290 characters.


            Customize this array to suit your needs. If you want to generate
            audio more frequently

            to optimise latency, you can reduce the values in the array. Note
            that setting the values

            too low may result in lower quality audio. Please test and adjust as
            needed.


            Each item should be in the range 50-500.

            This is an advanced setting that most users shouldn't need to use.
            It relates to our generation schedule.


            Use this to attempt to immediately trigger the generation of audio,
            overriding the `chunk_length_schedule`.

            Unlike flush, `try_trigger_generation` will only generate audio if
            our

            buffer contains more than a minimum

            threshold of characters, this is to ensure a higher quality response
            from our model.


            Note that overriding the chunk schedule to generate small amounts of

            text may result in lower quality audio, therefore, only use this
            parameter if you

            really need text to be processed immediately. We generally recommend
            keeping the default value of

            `false` and adjusting the `chunk_length_schedule` in the
            `generation_config` instead.

            you have finished sending text, but want to keep the websocket
            connection open.


            This is useful when you want to ensure that the last chunk of audio
            is generated even when the length of text sent is smaller than the
            value set in chunk_length_schedule (e.g. 120 or 50).
